# Advent of code - 2024 - Petcu Dragos

Solution:

The solution for this problem is what I wanted to do for problem 1 from this day. 
That is, parsing the string char by char and forming the functions and adding the sum.
I parse, when I encounter do() I set a boolean to true. Then I take into consideration 
the mul function when I encounter it. If I encounter don't I am only looking for the do() function.

More info is in code with comments, hope it is clear.
